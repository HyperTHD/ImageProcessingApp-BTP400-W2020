# ImageProcessingApp-BTP400-W2020-
Image Processing Application to compare 2 images based on RGB values (Using ImageJ, and JavaCV libaries along with BufferedImage and ImageIO built-in classes)

Researched topics for the purpose of applied research:

* ImageJ open source library (for computer vision)
* Computer Vision (along with computer vision in Java)
* JavaCV, a Java port of OpenCV, to allow for operations related to Computer Vision
* BufferedImage and ImageIO libraries 

What's needed to be finished before Week 12 deadline:

* Continue exploration of JavaCV
* See if similar operations can be accomplished with instance and class methods in the built BufferedImage and ImageIO classes
* Possible enhancements given enough time
