# ImageProcessingApp-BTP400-W2020
Image Processing Application to compare 2 images based on RGB values (Using ImageJ, and JavaCV libaries along with BufferedImage and ImageIO built-in classes)

Researched topics for the purpose of applied research:

* ImageJ open source library (for computer vision)
* Computer Vision (along with computer vision in Java)
* JavaCV, a Java port of OpenCV, to allow for operations related to Computer Vision
* BufferedImage and ImageIO libraries 

Images must be of the same pixel size, otherwise algorithm used will determine both images to be not the same

To Run:

- Compile main java class
- Run program with minimum of 2 command line arguments, both being the images being compared

There are bugs with this program, but nothing that breaks the program. Will probably return to this project at another point to potentially review and make any changes that are necessary. Submitted on 3/28/2020
